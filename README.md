# learning_python
All the python thingies I've started playing with

As I normally work with Jupyter Noteebooks for work, I've decided to begin learning advanced Python for Data Analysis and Visualization. I will add the projects here as I learn them, in the hopes that I will one day look back at my progress I've made, and perhaps create a new version with more advanced methods.
